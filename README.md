# Minecraft CPU Project - CHUNGUS 2

## Project Overview
This project simulates and generates components for an advanced CPU architecture within Minecraft, leveraging tools such as schematic generation and emulation. The CPU, named CHUNGUS 2, is designed to execute assembly-like instructions and produce Minecraft-compatible schematic files for in-game structures like redstone circuits or other logic components.

The project supports:
- Translating assembly-like instructions into a machine-readable format.
- Generating schematics compatible with Minecraft for these instructions.
- Simulating instruction execution through an emulator (in progress).

---

## Features
- **Assembly Preprocessing**: Processes assembly-like scripts to prepare for translation.
- **Instruction Translation**: Converts instructions into a usable format for schematics and emulation.
- **Minecraft Schematic Generation**: Creates in-game structures corresponding to the translated instructions.
- **Emulation (Planned)**: Simulates the behavior of the instructions to test functionality outside Minecraft.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.9 or higher**
- **Modules and Tools**:
  - `assembler`: Preprocessing and translating assembly code.
  - `schemgenerator`: Generates Minecraft-compatible schematic files.
  - `emulator`: Simulates instruction execution (optional).
- **Minecraft Tools**:
  - Minecraft-compatible tools for importing schematic files.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sammyuri/minecraft.git
   cd minecraft
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage
### Running the Main Script
To process and generate schematics:
1. Ensure that the `.s` assembly files are located in the `chasm_scripts` directory.
   - Examples:
     - `ports.s`
     - `constants.s`
     - `bank1.s`
     - `bank2.s`

2. Run the `main.py` script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Outputs
- Schematic files (`.schem`) will be generated for `bank1` and `bank2` in the project directory.

## Future Improvements
- Implement full emulation support for testing instruction execution.
- Add support for batch processing of multiple assembly scripts.
- Provide example Minecraft builds using the generated schematics.
- Optimize schematic generation for larger instruction sets.
